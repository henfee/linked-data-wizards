---------------------
Installation  (Linux)
---------------------

In order to run CODE Query Builder and Vis Builder, you need a current version of Python (>= 2.7.2).
Important: do not (!!!!!!) install Python 3 or higher, it currently does not work with CODE.

1) For installing the required dependencies, we recommend pip. You can then simply run
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

2) Copy ldva/settings.example.py to ldva/settings.py and adjust if necessary (e.g. the local SPARQL endpoint).

3) To initialize the development database, run
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py loaddata endpoints

4) For generating the Vis Wizard preview images, please install http://phantomjs.org/. Make sure the phantomjs binary can be found (i.e. put it in one of the paths in your PATH environment variable).

5) You can start the local development server by running
    python manage.py runserver


All commands should be run from the main project folder.

If everything worked, you should be able to access your local CODE Query Builder and Vis Builder at http://localhost:8000/


----------------------
Installation (Windows)
----------------------

In order to run CODE on Windows, you need a couple of additional (Preperation) Steps.

0a) Install Python >=2.7.2. Important: do not (!!!!!!) install Python 3 or higher, it currently does not work with CODE.
0b) Install pip, use this explaination: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-to-install-pip-on-windows
0c) On Win x64 systems, you probably get an error when installinig setuptools. If so, follow the instructions below:
       Step 1: Launch regedit.exe and locate the key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python".
       Step 2: With this branch selected, go to the File menu and select Export. Confirm that the "Export range" radio button is set to "Selected branch". Navigate to the directory in which to store your export, provide a File name (I used 'Python') and click "Save".
       Step 3: Open the export file in your favorite editor, and insert the "Wow6432Node" folder between "SOFTWARE" and "Python" so each line begins "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Python". Save the changes.
       Step 4: Double-click on the modified export file and Merge this registry data.

1) Open your windows command promt as Administrator. Type:
       pip install -r C:\PATH-TO-CODE-REPOSITORY\requirements.txt --upgrade

2) Continue with 2) in the Linux installation documentation

3) If you use Distribute and Pip (and probably also with Setuptools), and the install fails at some point,
        make sure that you clean c:\users\USERNAME\appdata\local\temp\pip-build-USERNAME before trying again. Pip has the nasty habit of not
        cleaning up after an unsuccessful installation, and what's even worse, it does not check for the versions once it has downloaded a
        package.
